# Statistical-Methods-II-Spring-2023
Repository of code for lab assignments completed for PQHS 432, the second half of a two-semester sequence. Lab assignments required demonstrations of mastery for core principles and fundamental skills with a few requiring deeper dives into more technically sophisticated material. Using R and R Studio, I demonstrated my ability to clean, visualize, and analyze provided data sets and produce attractive Quarto documents.

**Key topics included:**
-  Using modern data science tools to import, tidy/manage, explore, visualize, and communicate about data
-  Building models and making predictions
-  Effective use of R, RStudio, and Quarto to perform rigorous and replicable research
-  Thinking critically about study design and analysis
-  Using linear and generalized linear models to address exploratory, predictive, inferential, and causal statistical and analytic questions
-  Understanding the importance of replicable research and practicing in open source tools
